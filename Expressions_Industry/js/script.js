/*In my current job we support the iOS users and have over 45000 iOS devices deployed in the field.  When ordering devices and scanners that attach to the iPhones we have to know the average number of devies received each day, and the percentage of those devices that need to be replaced, and not just restored and reconfigured.  This program will allow the user to specify what device they are inputting the information for, the number received for each day, and the number that failed for each day.  It will output the results.*/
